<HEAD>AN ELEGY Upon that Renowned <HI>Hero and Cavalier,</HI> THE Lord CAPEL, Who (for his Loyalty) was Barbarously Murther'd in the <HI>Palace-Yard</HI> at <HI>Westâˆ£minster,</HI> on the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> day of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> 16<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="__"/></HEAD>
<P><HI>Preserved by a Loyal Person; And never before Printed.</HI></P>
<L>SO have I seen a frolick Bridegroom come,</L>
<L>And guild with smiles the gaudy Wedding-room,</L>
<L>Joy dancing on his Face, whilst in his Eye</L>
<L>The young Bride's Blushes kept true Harmony:</L>
<L>Just with that look the <HI>Romans</HI> Victors all</L>
<L>In Triumph rid unto the Capital;</L>
<L>But not the <HI>Deecij</HI> to their Death, their Eyes</L>
<L>Beheld but Fame, Thine blest Eternity;</L>
<L>Most like the Fire-prooft Martyr, that proclaims</L>
<L>His Conquest crown'd in Pyramids of Flames,</L>
<L>In ravishment of Soul; and leaves the Toy</L>
<L>Of Life, not with excess of Pain, but Joy.</L>
<L>I, so brave <HI>CAPEL</HI> fell; the Scaffold bore</L>
<L>No look of life, but he Dying wore,</L>
<L>Death lookt like Death, and all the standers by,</L>
<L>As if that he had come, to see them dye;</L>
<L>Envy her self Great <HI>CAPEL</HI>'s Triumph sung;</L>
<L>Earth groan'd his Exit; whilst all Heaven rung</L>
<L>With a loud Plaudit, extasi'd to see</L>
<L>This last Great Act, of his red Tragedy.</L>
<L>Treason combin'd, call'd <HI>Law established;</HI></L>
<L>Immediate Death by Tyrants menaced,</L>
<L>Could not his Rock-built Constancy abate;</L>
<L>But his Just Soul stood still Resolv'd like Fate.</L>
<L>And had the Machine of the whole World broke,</L>
<L>The Ruins still had him undaunted took:</L>
<L>To view his Life, would but redrown'd the Eye</L>
<L>Of his and Virtue's Friends; Truth's History</L>
<L>Shall write it to the Age unborn, and they</L>
<L>Peruse it with that Zeal good Vestals pray;</L>
<L>And that sad Page which tells his Death, appears</L>
<L>The Winding-sheet of many Sighs and Tears;</L>
<L>His Life, Why? 'tis a Theme for Angels meet;</L>
<L>But this I'le say, Of all the Heav'n-bound Fleet,</L>
<L>Of Crimson Martyrs, through the red Sea gon,</L>
<L>Of <HI>England</HI>'s Treason and Rebellion,</L>
<L>Except their matchless Royal Admiral,</L>
<L><HI>CAPEL</HI> came richest home in the Ark Loyal;</L>
<L>Where all the Stars shot Volleys, and was giv'n</L>
<L>Eternal Welcome to his Haven, Heaven.</L>
