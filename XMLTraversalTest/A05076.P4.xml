<HEAD>¶ To the ryghte hyghe and myghtye Prynce, Edward by the grace of God, Duke of Somerset, gouer∣nour of the kynges maiestees most royall person, and protectour of all his hyghnesse realmes dominions, and subiectes, Thomas Cooper wysheth all wealth and perfite felicitie.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>L be it (righte excellente prince (your affabilltye and cle∣mencie is such, and so great, that all people of euery state and de∣gree, as well poore as riche, maye at all conueniente times haue free accesse to your grace, and haue their reasonable suites complayntes, and peticions be∣nignely heard, and accordynge to equitee, iustice and good conscience depeched, so that therby it is verye likely that the true knowledge of the state and condicion of the weale publike, is at all tymes to your grace reueled &amp; opened: Yet because (well nere) in all common weales, and aboute all suche noble and good princes, there haue ben some, which for their owne commoditee, aduancement, displeasure or other affecti∣on, haue so letted and hindered <HI>true report,</HI> that it could not frankly come foorthe, it is a thyng much to be fea∣red, and with all wisedome and prudence to be foresene, lest any such might perchance hereafter couertly crepe in fauour, as by flatterye and dissimulacion, would en∣deuour to abuse your godly gentilnesse, as suche haue dooen the like natures of other most vertuous and wor¦thie gouernours before tyme: and by that meanes not onely blemyshe greatly the immortal prayses that your grace shoulde moost woorthily deserue of all men, for your godly and politike gouernaunce, but also tourne
<PB REF="3"/>
this noble realme to muche trouble and hindrance. For neuer did there chaunce greatter mischiefe to any com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n weale, neuer were the vertuous natures of greate rulers so soone corrupted, as either when they haue ben misinstructed and wronge infourmed by flatterers, or els when those that were in moste fauour and credyte, dissimu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the trueth, in stede of equitee &amp; iustice, haue wrought their owne purposes. Was not the good kyng <HI>Darius</HI> by wicked persuasiōs induced, euen against his conscience, to committe <HI>Daniel</HI> the prophete of god, to the daunger of the cruell and hungrie lions? had not the diuelish counsaile of <HI>Haman</HI> persuaded <HI>Assuerus</HI> with∣out cause to destroy the whole nacion of the Iewes, for malice that he bare to <HI>Mardocheus,</HI> ne had the singuler prouydence of God in <HI>Hester</HI> preserued theim? to what misgouernaunce and vicious liuyng did <HI>Perennius, Cle¦ander,</HI> &amp; other bring the emperour <HI>Commodus,</HI> notwith∣standing the graue and sage counsailours lefte hym by his father <HI>Marcus Antonius</HI>? did any thing so much cor∣rupte the nature of the valiant conqueroure <HI>Alexander,</HI> and so greatly blemish his fame and glorye, as that he had his eares so open to flatterers? whiche made hym to thinke, that he was the sonne of their greate god Iu∣piter? yea almoste that he was a god and no mortall man. Wherfore the wyse emperour <HI>Gordian</HI> had good cause to saie, that <HI>he was a wretched prince, from whom v ertuous counsaile &amp; the trueth of matters was hidde by flatery.</HI> Yea (&amp; in mine opinion) it were farre more tolle∣rable, that the soueraine were euyll him selfe, then that hys nere friendes, seruauntes, or famylyars, whome he trusteth, should bee flatterers, couetous, or malisyous. For suche persons shal not onely theim selfes dooe mu∣che euyl, but also by false informacion, corruptinge the high ruler (if it be possible) allure hym to dooe the lyke, to the peryll and daunger bothe of hym selfe and of the weale publike. Therfore wisemen haue alwayes iudged them most worthie, to be extremely punished, to the ex¦ample of al other, like as the noble emperour Alexander
<PB REF="3"/>
for his sharpe iustice named <HI>Seuerus,</HI> caused <HI>Vetronnis Thurinus</HI> with smoke to be smuddered to death, because in matters of suite he had taken bribes for false reporte of the emperours fauour. For the noble gouernour sus¦pecting no such eueil to be in them, (for how long wold it be, ere the wilie waies of such subtile re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nardes maye be spyed out) may lightly be misledde and do the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o he wold not, if he wist surely how the truth went. And this daunger hath alwayes bene so much the thynge be feared, as that witty men perceyuyng thinges to be in suchewise mishandled by theim that were in great fauour with their princes, durst not, or at the least wold not speake and discouer the greuous hurtes of the com∣men weale: some, for feare to be hindred by those fami∣liars, &amp; so to lose their dignitees, offices, &amp; auctoritees: some for great hope that they had, to be by their reporte commended, and therby aduaunced to some promocion or high roome in the common weale. So that I gather hereby (righte excellente prince) that of all other it is a thinge mooste difficile and harde to <HI>rule well,</HI> and for a chiefe magistrate and gouernour to be truly and with∣out dissimulacion informed in euerye case, as the nota∣ble saying of king <HI>Antiochus,</HI> doth well declare: who on a time of hunting, being strayed from his company and benighted, was fayne to take for his harborowe, a poore cotage of the countrey, and there, as he was vn∣knowen at supper with the vplandishe people, through communication, heard diuers thinges frelye talked of his owne behauour Therfore on the morow, when his ministers brought to him his purpre raiment and dia∣deme, he tourning to those ensignes sayed. <HI>Sins the time I first began to were you, yesterday only and neuer before I herd the truth frankly spoken.</HI> Wherfore the best and most sure waye for a noble gouernour, after the coun∣saile of the excellent philosopher <HI>Demetrius,</HI> is to reade such bookes, as most wittily and pithilye treate of the states of common weales, and namely histories in the which he shall playnelye see sette foorth before his eyes
<PB REF="4"/>
what best beseemeth him to dooe, what to eschew: what maye aduaunce the state of his common weale, what maye hurte and hynder the same: howe and by what meanes hatred and grudge is bredde toward him, and howe and by what wayes he maye wynne loue and fa∣uour: What maketh his realme weake, what maketh it stronge: What maketh it wealthye and riche, what maketh it poore and beggarly: what maketh it floryshe many yeres▪ what maketh it miserable in short space: in bookes shall he lerne to know the wilie flattering foxes, from his sure and trustye friendes: good and faythfull ministers, from false feigning dissemblers: Whom and how he ought to chose his counsaylours, how and what lawes he ought to make. Thus (I saye) he shall learne out of bookes to bee him selfe to him selfe, the best the trustest and surest counsaylour. And for thys consyde∣racion wold I wish, that the summes of all such lerned workes, were drawen out into short brigementes, to the ende that prudent gouernours (whych for theyr many∣folde affayres and businesses, haue but small tyme of leisure) myghte in liew of other playes, passe the tyme therwyth, like as the Epitome or brigemente of crony∣cles is, whych not many yeeres passed was begunne by a studious yong man named <HI>Thomas Lanquet,</HI> &amp; nowe of late by me finished▪ and continued, from the incarna¦cion of Christ, to the seconde yere of the reigne of our so¦ueraine lord king <HI>Edvvard the sixt.</HI> In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>che forme and ordre that a diligent reader may as in a mirrour behold the state and condicion of all realmes at all times, and know what gouernours ruled theim, how many yeres they reygned, and what notable actes were done in the time of their reigne, whan the <HI>Britaines,</HI> &amp; likewyse the <HI>Scottes,</HI> came fyrste into thys lande, with the succession of their kinges, and the whole discourse of the historyes of both countreis: so that ye may perceiue, what notable acte was done in any realme vnder euery king of Eng∣land, and what yere of his reigne. For the yeres of the kinges of this land be noted in the margent, wyth the
<PB REF="4"/>
yere of the worlde and of Christe. In the computacyon wee haue folowed the moste sure accompte of the byble and Hebrews, whiche dyffereth muche from Eusebius and other latine Croniclers. These my labours (suche as they be) most excellent prince, I thought most conue∣nient to publish in your Graces name, not for the wel handling of the same, nor yet because I iudged it wor∣thie so noble a Prince: but onely as I dyd of late exhi∣bite the correction of sir Thomas Eliotes Dictionarie to the kinges most royall maiestee, to testifie my louing and obedient herte toward his highnesse, so doe I nowe offer this symple gyfte to your Grace, as a witnesse or testimonie of the good zeale and loue, whiche all men ought (as well as I) to beare toward you, for your christian and vertuous gouernance, and especial∣ly for your godly zeale in aduancyng the true religion of christ: wishing continually with most hertie prayer, that you gouerning vs so benignely, so mercifully, so god∣ly, mought alwaye liue in moste happy felicitee, and bringe this diuersitee of opini∣ons to a perfite vnite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and concorde in Christes doc∣trine, that wee with mutuall loue and charitee, and hertye obedience towarde our prince, may geue condigne honour and worshyp vnto god, and im∣mortall prai∣ses to your name.

<HEAD>¶ Of the vse and profite of histo∣ryes, and with what iudgement they oughte to bee redde.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LBEIT FOR MANY CAVSES</HI> (whyche we shall hereafter recyte) the rea¦dyng of hystoryes doth indifferently auayle all men, yet moste specyallye it perteyneth to kynges and greatte prynces, whose boke it maye be worthely called, because that the knowledge thereof is moste profitable and necessary to all those, whyche haue the gouernaunce of cōmune weales. For not onely the hystoryes of the Gentiles, but also of the holy scryptures, doo in euerye place make mencyon of theym. The holy scryptures, besydes that they make vs certayne of the wyll and woorde of God, and also of the spyrytuall kyngedome of Chryste, teache vs polyticall ad∣ministracion, and set forth many notable examples, which in rulynge a publyke weale be necessary to bee knowen, and whereby the myndes of prynces maye be styerred to the study of true nobilitye and vertue. The hystoryes of the Gentyles declare the orygynall and begynnynge of greate empyres, and for what causes there hathe chaun∣ced in theim so gret and so straung alterations &amp; greuous commocyons. In the same is also conteyned preceptes of offyces and vertues, whereby the commune weales may most prosperousely be preserued, contynued and aduaun∣ced. And for thys cause hystoryes are moost worthy to be called the bookes of good princis and noble men. Nowe, forasmuche as vnto euery prynce there belongeth a dou∣ble vertue, that is, a politicall or externall, and a fayth and feare towarde god, Exaumples of them bothe be shewed to vs out of hystoryes. Therefore we wyll fyrste speake of ciuyle vertues. Princes, yea and all other, that haue auctorytye in greate affaires and hyghe matters, oughte those examples and actes chyefelye to consyder, wherby they maye be admonyshed, by what meanes they maye mooste prosperouslye exercyse them selfes in the gouer∣nance of the weale publike. They must sette before their eyes the examples of good kinges and rulers, and of them
<PB REF="30"/>
must they lerne the necessary dutye and the vpryght trade of gouerning their empyers, that in their reignes, besides the vtilitie and benefyte of the publyke weale, they regar∣ded nothing▪ that iustice and equitie they onely enbraced, that all misdemeanours and offences they greuously pu∣nished: and agayne, that towardes good men and pecible they were alwayes beneficiall and gentyl, that for euery cause they woulde not rayse vp warres, but by wynkinge at iniuryes, reteyne peace, and yet in defence of theyr roy∣almes, were neuer the lesse of an inuincible courage and redye will: finally that by their wysedome, power, and strength, that defended their dominions from all outward hostilitye, and the same in true religyon, welth, quietnes, and in all necessarye artes made to flouryshe. In all whi∣che qualities our most excellent &amp; gracious prince Henrye the eyghte, hath excelled, and is an example to theym all whiche shall succeede. For in hym alone is coniested and heaped all the sundry good qualities of the auncient kyn∣ges, by whyche they opteyned so great renome. Whyche qualityes he hath so practysed in the gouernaunce of hys realme, That I suppose there neuer was in any common weale, any noble prince and gouernoure whiche hath de∣clared mo examples of wisedome, or shewed mo benefites and pleasures to hys countrey than hys grace hath. But to the purpose. For the contrary parte.</P>
<P>¶In the examples of tyrannes they maye obserue dy∣uers thynges: as, The ende of them to be miserable▪ and that through theyr crueltie many mischefes and daunge∣rous cōmocions haue chaunced in theyr common weales As it appereth how Pharao for tyrany peryshed, and for lyke cause the Romain kynges were exiled. Princes haue oftentymes distroyed one the other, only for pryde, disdain and enuy, and that many tymes begun vpon nothyng. E∣uen as it was the only cause of the cruel warres betwene Cesar and Pompei. The Romayne hystoryes shew, that the desyre of noueltie hath oft been the stirer of moost gre∣uous warres. And the sect and reygne of Machomet had none other begynnyng but of heresy and dissencion of the artycles of the fayth. It auaileth them muche that bee in auctoritye, to marke these thynges in the redynge of hysto¦ryes▪
<PB N="2" REF="30"/>
that they lerne to beware, foresee, and auoyde lyke thynges in their gouernance. For the same chances daily happen, all be it the persones nowe and than be chaunged in the commune weales, ne uerthelesse as pertaynynge to the similitude of busynes and trouble, the worlde remay∣neth the worlde, and lyke vnto it selfe. Therfore most tru∣ly Thucydides (who was a man excellente in the know∣ledge of warrefare, and also wrate the greatte and longe warre, and other sundrye thyges, whiche chanced among the Grekes) sayth, Hystoryes be a treasure, whiche ought neuer to be out of our handes, that therby beynge ayded, we maye the more commodiously handle suche busynesse and like chaunces in the commune weale, for as much as the causes often tymes chaunce almoste lyke.</P>
<P>¶Furthermore there be axaumples founde in hystoryes, conuenient for euery man priuately in his degree, as ma¦gistrates ought to be obeyede, and that they neuer escaped vnpunished, whiche haue rebelled against theym, euen as Dathan, Absalom, Catiline, Brutus, Cassus, and suche lyke for their sedicion haue ben worthily punished. Of the fidelitie of frendes, as Ionathas saued the lyfe of kynge Dauyd. Of the punyshment for homicide, adulterye, and suche lyke offences, as it appereth by the example of Da∣uid. But what shal nede many wordes. Euen as in euery arte paternes be geuen to folowe: lykewyse in hystoryes be peinted before our eyes examples of all kyndes of ver∣tues. But yet in examples and deedes it is more euydent∣ly perceyued, what the dignytye of vertue, and agayne, what the bacenesse of dyshonestee and vyces bee, than in bare preceptes, because that examples, set as images be∣fore vs, do not onely openly teache, but also bothe warne and stirre our myndes, so that therby wyth a certayne de∣lite and desyre they be kyndled towardes vertue and ho∣nestie. For who in hert can be so stubborne and hard, that will not be moued, if he rede anye thynge notable, that is either worthy prayse, or els exāples vtterly to be abhorryd</P>
<P>I haue shewed briefely how in readyng of hystoryes ex∣amples of politicall vertues and ciuyle affayres ought to bee obserued, Nowe it perteyneth to a true christen man. (who aboue all thynges oughte to esteeme godlynesse, to
<PB REF="31"/>
knowe, that he maye gather also out of hysteryes, exam∣ples of faythe and feare of god: For these be the specyall vertues of good men, which in the syghte of god be moste auailable. Al be it that the hystoryes of the gentyles doo not teache, that god careth or hath oughte to do wyth vs: yet a godly mynde neuerthelesse shall consyder, that the publyke weales in the worlde be conserued by the power of god, and that is the worke of god to punyshe and re∣uenge all oppressyon, and vyolence, ye and that vnto the heathen God gyueth excellent qualities. For princes can not preserue their empyers agaynst the assaultes of Sa∣than, wythout the syngular benefyt of god, and the ayde of theyr owne vertue and wisedome. And so by thys ma∣ner a good man maye well suppose, that these actes and punishmentes be the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkes of god, and therby may lern the feare of god. As that tyrannes haue been greuousely punyshed accordynge to thys sentence: He that taketh the sworde, that is, whyche wythout auctorytye vsurpeth the ryght of reuengyng, he shall peryshe by the sworde. Con∣trarywyse, it is euydent, that good prynces bee preserued and defended by god, and that also the Ethnykes did well perceyue, in that theyr princes had great affiaunce in the helpe of theyr goddes. For Homere the poete sayth: God casteth his sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elde in the batayle, to defende the prynces, He feigneth also euery prynce to be vnder the protectyon of his god, as it appereth by the goddesse Pallas, whyche alw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes was presente wyth Achilles. But this thynge is more playnely expressed in the hystoryes of the holy scryp∣ture, as in Noe, Abraham, Moses, Dauyd, Ezechias, and the other princes and kinges, whom god alwayes preser∣ued. And their examples be set before the eies of all other princes, that they maye certaynly know, that in lyke ma∣ner god wyll defende all good kinges. For thys difference is betwene the holy and prophane hystoryes, that in them be shewed the testymonies of the workes of god, and the whiche do not onely entreate of cyuile matters, but chief∣ly doo represente vnto vs the kyngdome of god, that god geueth his word, that of his mercy he wyll saue vs, wher in the hystoryes of the gentiles be ignorant. Therfore prin¦cipally the hystoryes of the holy scripture ought to be kno¦wen
<PB N="3" REF="31"/>
to all chrysten men, that therby they maye learne the doctryne and stablishement of faithe.</P>
<P>¶ Fyrst how all thynges were created of god, what was the originall of synne, that agaynst synne Christe institu∣ted his kyngdome, gaue hys woorde, and that he shoulde come to take away sinne, and saue vs. Also how god, whā he had gyuen his worde, preserued alwayes the reygne of Chryst, and that the reigne of Christe, that is, the true be∣leuers from the begynnynge of the worlde, walked vnder the crosse, and neuerthelesse were pre serued. That Sathā wyth all the power of the worlde assaulted the worde of god. Moreouer, that God meruaylously perfourmed hys promyse aboue the opinyon and capacitie of mans wytte. Also that examples bothe of horyble vengeance, and also of grace and forgyuenes be shewed to vs of God, So vn¦to kyng Dauid and other chanced remission of syns, that by theyr examples we myghte bee comforted and beleue, that god wyll forgyue. Neyther thys is to be neglected that for the confyrmacion of our myndes, God hath ge∣uen vs all sortes of prophecies of externall kyngdomes, that by the fulfillying of them, we maye haue a testimony that our woorde is of god, neyther that any other faythe than ours, is true. And that we maye bee admonyshed by them, whan Christ ought to come, and whan the consum¦macion of the worlde shall be. Finally, for the ryghte vn∣derstandyng the prophecyes, it shall be very expedyent to knowe the successe and alteracion of the monarchies and kyngdomes, wyth the computacyon and noumber of the yeres, whyche be in the hystoryes of the Gentiles exactly set foorth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the knowledge wherof, euen for thys cause is necessarie for chrystians, that they maie the better vnder∣stande the prophecyes, and of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the more certaynely iudge. Certes euery man maye by these thynges esteme, what pleasure and profyte is gathered in readynge of hy∣storyes, and the fruitefull commoditye therof ought wor∣thily to stire and compell euery man to knowe them.</P>

<P>¶On the other parte, the Scithyans supposed the tempe∣ratenes of the ayre to be no argumente of antiquitee. For nature, whan she deuided colde and heate into regyons, forthwith ingendred creatures apt to suffer the qualityes of the places, yea and trees, fruytes, and herbes accor∣dyng to the disposicyon of the regyons. And howe muche more sharper the ayre is to the Scithians, than to the Ae∣gypcians, so muche the harder be they of bodye and wyt. Moreouer, if the worlde, whyche nowe is deuyded into e∣lementes, hath ben confused all in one, eyther the water in the begynnynge sourroundyng al thynges, or elles the fyre, whiche also ingendred the world, possessynge it, the Scithians in the originall of bothe begynnynges were the more anciente. For if the fyre fyrste possessed all thyn∣ges, whiche by lyttell and lytell quenched, gaue place to the earth, there was no place so soone disseuered from the fyre, by the colde of wynter, as the northe, in so muche as nowe there is no lande so vehement colde. Aegypt, and al the east was very long, ere they were temperate, bycause that nowe they be euen seared with the feruent heat of the sonne, Or yf all the erthe at the firste was couered wyth waters, certes the highest partes, the waters assuagynge, were fyrst discouered, and in the lowest groundes dyd lon¦gest abyde, and the sooner that euerye parte of the earthe was dry, so muche the sooner began it to bryng foorth ly∣uynge creatures.

Which Aegypt (of long time hath ben defended with the cares and char∣ges of so manye kynges, fortified with so greate bankes agaynst the violence of watres, trenched out with so ma∣ny dyches, that where the water is kepte out in one place, it may be receiued in another, coulde not be inhabited, on∣lesse Nilus were helde out) can not seme to be of any anti∣tiquitie, but rather appeareth to be a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e countrey, either by the heapynges of kynges, or els by the castynge vp of the mudde of Nilus.</P>

God therby perceyuyng, that the wickednes of man was great vpon the erth, repented that he had made man, not that there is any suche passion in god, but that the scrip∣ture so speaketh to vs after a familiar and worldlye ma∣ner: and therfore thretned a destruction to the worlde by a floudde, and wolde therfore Noe to declare this .120. yeres before it shulde come. In the meane tyme he com∣manded hym, that he should builde an arke, that shoulde conteyne in lengthe .300. cubites, whiche after the expo∣sicion of Hugo and S. Augustine, were .300. perches, eue∣ry cubite geometricall beyng six cōmon cubites: in wide∣nesse it was .l. perches, and in depenesse, from the vpper decke to the bottome .xxx. perches, and the roufe ouer it in height one perche. This arke was not by mans power brought into the sea, but by the course of the waters, ry∣synge vp, it was borne awaye, and rather by the diuine prouidence, than by mans policie, it was gouerned from renuynge to wrecke. Noe began to builde this in the .523. yere of his lyfe, before the floud, as Berosus witnesseth, 78. yeres. In the .vi.C. yere, the seconde moneth, the lorde saied vnto Noe, that after seuen dayes this deluge shulde fall, in whiche space he brought into the arke, his stuffe, prouision, and al other thynges necessary for hym. Wher¦at euery man laughed, and toke hym as one madde, that dreamed of suche a floud. But finally (as it is written in the gospell) thei were eatyng and drynkyng, they maried and wer maried, euen vnto the daye that Noe entred the arke, and wolde not knowe it vntill the deluge came, and destroied them all. Not that it was vnknowen vnto them but that thei dispised to beleue it. For Noe shewed it to them as well in woorde as in deede. Also the buyldyng of the arke was a certaine declaracion therof, but thei were without faith and feare of God, for whyche cause they were worthily punished. Thus the tyme passyng, the .17.

And beholde, so∣deinly there came together vnto him bestes of al kindes, not brought thither by man, but euen by the miracle of god. Neither did Noe take theym, but suffered theym as they came to entre, ne there came anye more than of vn∣cleane beastes two, a male and a female, of cleane bestes seuen, foure males and three females, of the which one male was reserued for sacrifice after the floud, the resy∣due were kept for generacion.</P>

For by these thre princes gouer∣nance and fortune, the hole posteritee of Noe was ruled. Nemroth was a man veray bold and eloquent in tunge, and sayed: That the felicitee of man ought not to be as∣cribed vnto god, but that rather euerye man obteineth it by his owne industrie. For which cause he perswaded the people to builde an high towre, ouer the whiche the wa∣ter shuld not arise, and that the top thereof should reache euen to the heauens. The multitude were ready to fulill the commaundementes of Nemroth, esteming the obey∣saunce of god to be a greuous bondage, and builded the towre. But as soone as they began, God foorthwith (as the holye scripture testifieth) by this meane dashed the pride of the buylders. That where so many nacions ga∣thered together, which in number were .lxx. vsed but one language or speche, god so confused theyr tongues, that euery one of theim spake in sundry speches, that the one might not vnderstand the other: wherby of necessitee the woorke was lefte vnfinished, and they scattered abrode through al the world.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is to be vnderstand, that those thinges,</HI> which be done of magistrates and ru∣lers, ought to be taken and honoured as the worke of god. We haue war∣ned afore ī our preface, that god wold the world to be gouerned by .iiii. mo∣narchies, y<SUP>e</SUP> policie, iustice, &amp; correctiō might be kept amōg mē: therfore ma∣ny thinges be spoken of them in scripture.

For (sayeth he) the gol∣den head signifieth the first monarchie, which was of the Assyrians: the siluer breast, the kingdome of the Persiās: the brasen bealy, the reygne of the Macedons: the yron legges, the empire of the Romains: the earthen and yron feete, do betokē this present state of the empire of Rome, because that at this season it is of lesse power and reputa∣cion than it hath bene.</P>

<P>About this time, thorough the warres and dissencion of the Iues, there arose among them sundrye sectes and opiniōs in theyr religions, of which there were .iii. sorts.</P>
<P>The first were called <HI>Pharisei,</HI> that is, segregate or cho∣sen. They vsed certayne constitucions of men beside the lawe of Moyses, by whiche they were segregate frome the residue of the people. They reputed theim selfes bet∣ter then all other, they obserued feigned fastes, prayed commonly in the stretes, that they might be sene and cal¦led maisters. Their learning was some what better thē the others. For they taught the immortalitie after this lyfe, and that god would punishe sinne: they bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued al∣so Messias to come to saue such as beleued, and to iudge suche as sinned.</P>
<P>The second sect were Sadduceis, they cloked theyr wic∣kednes vnder a glorious name. For <HI>Sadducei</HI> is as much as iuste or holy. They taught, that there was neyther an¦gell, spirite, nor life after death: that god gaue the lawe onely for this, that honestly and quietly we should lyue receiuing of god here in this life the rewards of iustice. They interpreted the scriptures according to the iudge∣ment of mans reason: neither any other thing wold they here, &amp; as concerning that which pertained to the maner of theyr liuing, they were plain Epicures. A wonderfull thing to be hard, that such ethnike opinions shuld crepe

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Haue hitherto briefli ronne ouer the liues of .72. kinges, which reigned here in Bri∣taine from the arriuall of Brute vnto the comming of Cesar: the history wherof (as I said before) is very vncertaine &amp; obscure. Yet neuerthelesse I haue not varyed from the vulgar opinion therof, but haue brought the same in to a more certaine ordre, conferring them with the other

histories and gestes of the world, wherby they haue a bet¦ter apparance of truth. But now, that I am come to this time, in which the Britons beganne to be knowen to the Romaines, and other nacions of the world, hauing also the helpe of credible historiens, whiche before I lacked, I shall the more veritably and in better order set foorthe our histories. And for the better declaracion of this chro∣nicle, you shall vnderstande, that the numbres set in the inner side of the page, signifie the yeres of the reignes of the kīges of Britain, wherby may be perceiued in what yere of the reigne of a kinge, anye notable thinge in the world was done. As for the historye of Cesar I haue ga∣thered it out of his cōmentaries, and out of the worship∣ful Beda whome I thinke more credible than our newe historiens.</P>
<P>VUhen C. Iullus Cesar had warred seuen yeres in Fraunce and Germany,<MILESTONE N="52" UNIT="The yere before Christe"/><MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Anni regum britannie"/> comming vnto that part where Calais and Bolayne now stande,<MILESTONE N="3911" UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/> he deter∣mined to make warre into Britaine: whyche vntill that time remayned vnfrequented and vnknowen of the Ro∣maines. His quarell was, because that in the warres of France, he perceyued the Frenchmen to haue much suc¦cour and ayde from thense. Wherfore preparinge .lxxx. shippes he sayled into Britain. Where at the first being weried with an harde and sharpe batayle, and after with sodein tempest his nauy almoste destroyed, he retourned again into Fraunce, there to winter his men. The nexte springe,<MILESTONE N="3912" UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/><MILESTONE N="51" UNIT="The yere before Christe"/> his nauy beinge newe rigged and encreased,<MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="Anni regum britannie"/> he passed the seas agayne with a greater army: but whiles he went towarde his ennemies on lande, his shippes ly∣ing at ankor, were againe by tempest almost lost, for ey∣ther thei were driuen on the sides, where thei stack fast or els beyng driuen one vpon an other were destroyed so that .xl. perisshed, the other with muche labour were sa∣ued. Upon lande also his horsemen ot the first encounter were vanquished, and Labienus the tribune slayne. At the seconde conflicte, not withoute great daunger of his men, he put the britons to flight, and poursued theym to the riuer Thamis: on the further side wherof Cassiuelā with a great multitude of people was kepinge the ban∣kes,

but they not hable to resiste the violence and force of the Romains, hid them selues in woodes, &amp; with sodeine eruptions oftentimes inuaded them. But in the meane time theyr strongest citee Troynouāt▪ submitted it self to Cesar, deliuering vnto him hostages: whiche exāple also the other cities folowed. Whereby Cassiuelan after ma∣ny losses, was constreigned to giue pledges, and to agre that Britaine should be tributary to the people of Rome Then Cesar, like a conquerour with great noumbre of prisoners, sayled into Fraunce. Thus ended the warres which he made in Britain, whereby he rather opened o waye for his successours to come to the same, thā that he deliuered to them the dominion thereof. This conqueste was made .2255. yeres after the vniuersall floude .1057. after the arriuall of Brute .702. after the buyldinge of Rome, in the second yere of the .182.

Antonius wedded her, who warred against Augustus: of whom he was ouerthrowē for sorowe wherof, she closed her selfe in a tombe being on liue, and hauing two adders suckinge on her brestes, so died. She was a woman excellinge in plesauntnes quickenes of witte, and sumptuous ryotte, in so muche that at one (banket contending with Antonius in excesse of fare,) she drank aperle resolued in vineger, which was estemed at .100.

the consul withstode it, and the senate also decreed, that Cesar should not entre the city, without he dimissed his armye. For whiche cause Cesar being displeased, came frō Rauenia, passing ouer Rubicon, to Ariminium. In the meane while Pompeius, with the consulles, fled to Dyrra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiū in Grece, and Cesar entred Rome, spoiled the tresoury, and besieged Marsiles.</P>
<P>Aristobulus, being deliuered by Cesar, went into Iu∣dea, where he was poysoned, and Alexander his son put to death by Scipio.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1916" UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/><MILESTONE N="47" UNIT="The yere before Christe"/> Cesar in Corfinio,<MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="Before Britayne knovven"/> by submission receyued the armye of Domitius, and suffered him to go frelye awaye. In Spaine he vanquished Petreius &amp; Afranius he retur∣ned to Marsiles, and tooke the towne. From thence he went to Dyrrachium, where he was ouercome and put to flight by Pompeius, and .2400. of his men slayne. And Thessaly they met in the feldes Pharsalia, wher a cruell and doubtful bataile was fought: but at lengthe Pompei was put to flighte, and loste .15000. of his soul∣diours.</P>
<P>¶Pompeius, sleing to Alexandria in Egipt was slaine by the tutours of the yonge Ptolome,<MILESTONE N="1917" UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/><MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="The yere before Christe"/><MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="Before Britayne knovven"/> and his head sent vnto Ceser. Who seing it, wept. Thus ended the noble Pompei his life, who for his sundry and incomparable victories, was surnamed the great; he was indued with many noble and princely vertues both of body &amp; minde he had so good a grace in his visage, that from his child hode he meued the people of Rome most entierly to fa∣uoure him, and also for his singular beneuolence, cōti∣nence of liuing, marcial experience, pleasantnes of spea¦che, fidelitee of maners, and easines in speking to, was meruailously estemed, he neuer required any thīg with out shamfastnes, or granted any thing but with a glad countinaunce. In his visage appered alway both nobi∣litie and gentilnes, so that when he was in his flouris∣shing youthe, there shined in him maners both princely and reuerent. When he was sent into Sicily by Sil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a perceyuing that the souldiours, which were vnder his guiding, scatered and robbed the countreys as he went he commanded euery one of theyr swordes to be signed

with the seale of his ringe, that they shoulde do no wrong to any man by the waye, wherin he declared him selfe to be not onely a valyaunt, but also a iust and righteous ca∣pitaine.</P>
<P>Cesar entered Alexandria, and beinge prouoked to ba¦tail, he vanquished theym, and sette on fyre the nauye of the Egipcians, the flame whereof inuaded the lybrarye of Philadelphus, wherein were burned .40000. bookes. The kinge rebellinge agayne, was slayne with all his ar¦mye, and Cleopatra his sister, restored to the royalme. Then went he into Pontus against Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates, whom at the first encountre he ouerthrue</P>
<P>C.

In this yere he warred against the Pom∣peians in Aphrike, and vanquished theym at Tapsus, where he toke theyr campe, and .60. elephantes.</P>
<P>Cato for greefe and sorowe of herte that he had, that his countrey should by Cesar be brought in seruage and thraldome, slue him selfe in U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ica.

And Cesar commaunded the Neph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eus of the greatte Pompei, and his daughter Pompeia, to be put to death.</P>
<P>Cesar entred Rome with four triūphes,<MILESTONE UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/><MILESTONE N="44" UNIT="The yere before Christe"/> and was cre¦ated the fourth time consull,<MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="Anni regum britannie"/> and continuall dictatour, taking on him to be monarche of the whole impire, whi∣che thinges brought to passe, he prepared to make warre against the sonnes of Pompei, in Spayne, where fortune was diuers betwene them. And in the last battayle why¦che was at Munda, a towne in Spayne, they foughte soo sore and harde togither, and suche slaughter was made that the old and assured souldiours of Cesar were not a∣shamed to geue backe, wherby Cesar despairinge to wyn that fielde, would haue killed him selfe, leste after the re∣noume of so many cōquestes and victories, he shuld haue fallen in the power of those yonge men, whose father he had vanquished. But finally, succouring his men, the ar¦mye
<PB REF="114"/>
of the Pompeis was put to flight, the one of the bre∣therne beinge slayne, the other fleing away. After whiche battayle, Cesar finished those ciuile warres, whiche du∣ring the space of .v. yeres, troubled the whole world. Antipater by Cesar was cōstituted procuratour of Iudea</P>
<P>Cesar retourned to Rome, he reformed the state of the common weale, amended the calender, reducinge the or∣der of the yere, to the course of the sonne, founde out the cause of the leape yere, and in his honour and memorye, the people attributed to him the moneth Quintilis, whi∣che after his name was called Iulius. But he contynued not passing .v. monethes in reste, for waringe insolent a∣gainste the senatours, and takinge theyr lybertee frome theim, there conspired against him to the numbre of .260. senatours and gentilmē, among whom Brutus and Cas¦sius were chiefe, Whiche in the Ides of Marche, when Cesar came into the senate house, with .xxiii. woūdes, he was slain among the senatours. Thus Cesar lost al that whiche wyth the bloude of .lx. M. citezens, and .1192000. his ennemies, he had gotten. And as he had filled all the world with his ciuile bloud: likewise nowe he filled the se¦nate with his owne bloud. After this sorte Cesar finished his life, a man in featnes of warre excellinge al other, he wrote no man swifter, and red no man faster, at one time he could endite foure letters at ones, he was furthermore of suche clemency, that those whome he had subdued by warre, with his great gentilnesse, wonne them to be hys veray frendes.</P>

Whose enter∣prise, and the honest affection, that he therein declared to∣warde his countrey, I thinke worthye memorye. For if he might haue gon through as he begō, and wel brought forwarde the same: vndoubtedly it woulde greatly haue delighted theim that take pleasure to reade the notable and famous thinges done longe before our tyme. For he hathe briefely set foorthe the gestes and actes of forayne and straunge countreis, and therwith iuigned the hysto¦rie of this realme of Englande, after the opinion of most writers, euen from the firste arriuing of Brutus, in such wyse, that a diligent reader maye gather, the variable state and condicion of all countreis and nacions at all ty¦mes. But deathe (whiche spareth no man, ne can bee es∣chewed) brake his course, and (as it were) trypped hym in the myddes of hys rase, that he coulde not atteyne to the marke, wherat he ranne. Wherfore, lest they that de¦syre the profitable knowlege of histories, should be desti¦tuted of so great a commoditee: and lest the fruites of so diligent a labour shoulde lye hydde, and tourne to the pro¦fyte of no man: At the instance of certaine of my nyghest frendes, whose requestes (the matter so standing) I could not well denie: I haue taken vpon me to fynishe this cro∣nicle, although in dede.

<P>Moreouer the acte made in the .xxxii. of the reigne of kyng Henry the eight concernyng contractes of matri∣monie, was in this parliament repealed, for that many beastly persons, maliciousely enterpreting the same, did by obtaynyng the firste carnall copulation, take frome honest men their despoused wyues.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Seimour lord Seimour of Sudley high admyrall of Englande,<MILESTONE UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/><MILESTONE UNIT="The yere of Christ"/><MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Anni regum Angli"/> was by parliament attainted of treason, for which his head was striken of at the tower hill in London the .xx. of Marche.

<P>In Maie folowynge Peter Martyr and the diuines of Oxforde, disputed openly of the Lordes supper and the presence of Christe therein. These questions dyd Peter Martyr propone and defend. That the substance of bread &amp; wyne is not changed, and that the body and bloude of Christ is not carnally and corporally in the breade and wyne, but is sacramentally vnited or knitte therevnto.

<P>In Iune folowyng, the French kyng came to Parys, with great pompe, and this was the fyrst commynge of hym thyther after the deathe of his father, where at his beyng there, and in his presence, as some thynke, many were put to death for Luthers doctrine. And the kynge, as it appered by a writyng then set forthe in printe, and sent into all partes of Fraunce, was there professed an open enemy to that sorte of men, determynyng to roote theim quite out of his dominions.

<P>About this tyme, there began in England great sedi∣tion emong the people in all partes, but chiefely in Nor∣folke and in Deuonshire.

<P>The .xxiij. of this monethe Edwarde duke of Somerset was beheaded at the towre hyll in London, where at the tyme of his speakynge to the people, there felle suche a sudden feare amonge the people by reason of a rumoure that ran abrode of the duke of Northumberlādes power of horsemen to be in a redinesse about the Citye, and an horse man that came in hastilye at the northe syde of the towre hill that they fell to shufflynge and thrustynge, as men that stoode in daunger of their lyues.

tower dytche. At the laste whenne the people perceyued that there came no mo horsemenne, they supposed that he that was comen, had brought a pardon for the Duke, and therefore they beganne to shoute and cast vp theyr cappes. Whyche thynge when the duke perceyued, he beckened with his cappe in his hande for silence. And that obtayned, he wylled the people to quiete theim sel∣ues, to obeye the rulers, and to loue theyr yonge kynge, and to pray to god for hym, that he myght long lyue and reigne ouer theym. As for hym selfe, he loked for no par¦don, other then at Goddes hand. And so he prepared him selfe to the axe, wherin he behaued hymselfe so soberly and humbly, that none so harde herted about hym, that dyd not shedde teares.</P>
<P>The .xxv. day of February, there we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hanged at the towre hyll for the dukes matter, syr Rafe Fane, and sir Myles Partriche knyghtes, and syr Thomas Arundell, and syr Myghell Stanhope beheaded.</P>
<P>The sommer folowyng, the kyng wente in progresse into the weste countreye, wherein his yonge affections were fedde by them that were about hym, not withoute great daunger of his lyfe, by outragious ridyng in hau∣kyng and huntyng. Towardes wynter he retourned to London, &amp; frō thens he went to Grenewich, wher was prepared matter of pastyme, a fort counterfaited, riding at the tylte, and goodly pastimes at Christmas, tyll the kyng had gotten a cough that brought hym to his ende.</P>
<P>The fyrst day of Marche was holden a parliament at Westmynster,<MILESTONE N="5514" UNIT="The yere of the worlde"/><MILESTONE N="1553" UNIT="The yere of Christ"/><MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Anni regum Angli"/> and continued there tyll the dissolution of the same, whiche was the laste daye of the same mo∣nethe. In this parlyament it was emong other thynges enacted, that no maner of man shoulde selle or vtter by retayle to be dronken in his owne house any kynde of wyne, vppon payne of forfaiture of tenne pounde for euery suche offence.</P>
<P>In this meane whyle there were three noble shyppes furnyshed for the great aduenture of the vnknowen vi∣age into the easte by the northseas. The great encoura∣ger of this voiage was Sebastian Gaboto, an englishe∣man, borne at Bristow, but a Genoways sonne.
<PB REF="325"/>
These shyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dyd shortly after passe galla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly by Grene∣wiche in the kynges presence, one of the maryners stan∣dyng vpon the mayne topmaste of one of them.</P>
<P>At the same tyme there were other lyke shyppes sette forthe towardes the southe to seke aduentures.</P>
<P>All this meane whyle kynge Edwarde was sycke, And his councellours linckinge them selues by marya∣ges. And muche talke ther was that the kynge was poy¦soned, and some suffered imprisonment and punishmen∣tes for so sayeng, and also for sayeng that he was deade. In fine, the tenthe day of Iuly, it was by proclamation declared in London, that he dyed the .vi. day of that mo∣neth. And at the same tyme, there was a prayer setforth in printe, vnder the testimonye of syr Thomas Wroth, one of the priuie chaumber, and doctoure Owen one of the kynges phisitians, with others: wherein the kyng a lyttell before he departed, besought God to preserue this realme from popery.</P>
<P>In the abouenamed proclamation whiche was sette forth by the consente of the duke of Northhumberlande and all the learned counsell of this realme, very fewe ex∣cepted, emong whome Iustice Hales of Kent was one, and of the Mayre and Aldermen and common counsell of the Citie of London, and moste parte of the Nobi∣litie, ladye Iane, daughter vnto Henrie Duke of Suf∣folke was proclaimed Queene, contrarye to that order that was taken in parliamente for the succession of the Crowne in the later daye of kyng Henry the eight, pre∣tendynge the feare of that whiche folowed in dede, that yf Mary should raigne, she would bring in foren power and the bishop of Rome.</P>
<P>But God, who wil not haue his truth mayntayned by puttyng heyres from theyr right: cōfounded their wise∣dom. And by that woman whō they wold haue shuldred frō her right, he punished their vnsaciable gatherynge of tresure vnder theyr good kyng. For he so turned the her¦tes of the people to her &amp; against them, that the ouercam them without bloudshed, not withstandinge there was made great expedition against her both by sea and land.</P>
<P>For when the counsell at London perceyued that the

common people woulde not stande with theim, and that certayne noble men began to go the other way: they tur∣ned their tale, &amp; proclaymed the lady Mary, eldest daugh¦ter to kyng Henry, and appointed by parliament to suc∣cede Edwarde, dyeng without issue.

And suche as woulde stycke to the lawes made in Kynge Edwardes tyme tyll other sholde be established: were some of them marked and some pre¦sently apprehended, amonge whome Sir Iames Hales a knight of Kent, and iustice of the common place was one.

And further he exhor¦ted them to geue thankes to god that hadde geuen them suche a kyng and quene. And laste of all, he dyd them to vnderstande, that he toke it for a great benefite at theyr handes that they had restored hym to hys former estate, and therfore he accompted him selfe the more bounde a great deale, to restore them to the heauenly court, which thinge he most desyred of all thynges. And when he had thus spoken, he went out of the parliment house.</P>
<P>Then stode vp the lorde chauncellor byshop of Win∣chester, and repeted the Cardinalles oration, with ma∣ny wordes of exhortation to concorde and vnitie, affir∣myng, that we oughte to geue moste harty thankes to god, that of his vnmeasurable mercy had styred vs vp a prophete of oure owne nation, whiche geueth hymselfe wholly to doo vs good.</P>
<P>The day folowyng, when the parliament had graun∣ted the Cardinalles request, they deuised a forme of sup∣plication to the kyng and queene, wherein they myghte moste humbly beseche them to be meanes to the Cardi∣nall for theim. The effect whereof was this. That they dyd earnestly repent them of theyr scisme, in refusynge to obey the apostolike sea of Rome, and in consentynge to lawes made against the same: promysyng that thence foorth they would be at theyr cōmandement to do what soeuer they shulde be able to do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that parliament, for the abolyshyng of all suche lawes and statutes.</P>

<P>Afterwarde, he declared, howe acceptable in the sight of god, the repentance of a synner is, and howe greatly the angels reioyce ouer one sinner that repēteth. And in conclusion he gaue thanks to God, that had geuen them a mynde so desyrous of emendement. when this was done, he arose, and so dyd the kyng and quene also, and then fell the kyng and quene doune on theyr knees. Thā dyd the Cardinall lyfte vp his fyngers, and blesse them, desyryng god to loke mercyfully vpon the people, and to forgeue the offence, and so he absolued the whole multi∣tude. And after this, they wente to the chappell, where thankes were geuen to god with pypynge and syngyng after the maner. Suche as knewe Pole before, and had had acquayntance with hym, meruailed muche at these doynges. For they looked for farre other thynges at his hande.</P>
<P>Nowe was the kyng, the quene, and all the commons at a good poynt, and in case mete to procede to the aduā∣cyng of Antichriste, and treadynge Christe vnder fote in his members, as thei dyd, in that they renued thre sta∣tutes for the punisshement of Christes people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>whome they call heretikes) and in repealynge statutes made a∣gaynst the apostolike sea of Rome, as they terme it.
